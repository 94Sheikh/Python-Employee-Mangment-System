# Python-Employee-Mangment-System

Project Name: "Employee Management System"

Project Description:

The project will be an employee management system that will allow the user to add new employees, display a list of all employees, search for an employee, and delete an employee from the system.

The program will use object-oriented programming to create an Employee class that will store information about each employee, including their name, age, and salary. The program will also use lambda functions, generator functions, and function decoration to sort and display the employee list.
